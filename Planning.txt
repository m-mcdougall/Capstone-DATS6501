Option 1: Hotel Information Business
Purpose: Find factors that have the most influence over hotel guest experiences. These elements are the most critical for hotels to focus on optimizing in order to ensure good experiences and return customers.
Dataset: Custom Scraped from hotel websites
Plan:
Create a script that scrapes hotel reviews for a given area - maybe by city or radius from a given address?

Find common factors that contribute to positive and negative reviews (eg, free wifi common in positive, bedbugs in negative)
For individual hotels, chart common positive and negative factors mentioned in reviews
For area also look for city-wide trends, such as proximity to local attractions, and possible regional correlations
For Overall look at correlations between star ratings for the hotel and different factors - what distinguishes a high-caliber hotel from the rest?

Can investigate impacts of specific words on review - eg, bedbugs probably have a much larger impact than rude staff

To-Do
---------------
#Baselines
Run baselines with larger sample
Make a table comparing baselines


#Feature importance
Read through all features, highlight interesting ones
Make a word cloud?


#Extracting the values
Make a sentiment grid of 20 sentiment-equivalent sentences for positive and negative
Make a function that samples all sentiments for each sentence, state and walkability combo
Save this into a grid


#Visualization
Be able to filter and sample the grid to see the differences by factor
Make map plot for overall rating
Use the highlighted features to show differences

#Storytelling
Talk about interpreting - how does a pool factor in to buisness decisions in various states?
